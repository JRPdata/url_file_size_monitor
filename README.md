# url_file_size_monitor
Monitor urls (ftp/http) for changes by polling the file size and notify when they change.

Based on code from commit_file_monitor for github.

See https://github.com/JRPdata/commit_file_monitor for general setup notes.

The notable difference is the confs for each url in conf/url only have one line (the url).
